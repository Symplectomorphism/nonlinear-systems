For the rotational motion of a rigid body in $3$D-space example, it is desired
to analyze the stability of an equilibrium of the form $(0, 0, z_0)$ where $z_0
\neq 0$. Set up a new set of coordinates such that the equilibrium under study 
is the origin of the new set. Define a suitable Lyapunov function such that the 
stability of the equilibrium can be established by applying Lyapunov stability 
theorem.
