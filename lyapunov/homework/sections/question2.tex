Suppose a particle of mass $m$ is moving in a smooth potential field. To
simplify the problem, suppose the motion is one-dimensional. Let $x$ denote the
position coordinate of the particle, and let $\phi(x)$ denote the potential
energy at $x$. If the only force acting on the particle is due to the potential,
then the motion of the particle is described by \[ m \ddot{x} = -\phi^\prime(x)
=: f(x), \] where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $x$. Show 
that every local minimum of the function $\phi$ is a stable equilibrium.
