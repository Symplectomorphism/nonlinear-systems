Show that a continuously differentiable map $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ with $f(x) \geq 0$ is radially unbounded if and only if it is proper
(inverse images of compact sets under $f$ are compact).

\begin{solution}

``($\Rightarrow$)'' Assume that $f(x) \xrightarrow{\norm{x}{} \to \infty}
\infty$. We want to show that for all compact $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
$f^{-1}(K) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact. Since $f$ is continuous, the
inverse images of closed sets under $f$ are closed sets. It remains to show that
if $K$ is (closed and) bounded in $\mathbb{R}$ then $f^{-1}(K)$ is bounded on
$\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $c = \max\{ x \in K \subseteq \mathbb{R} \}$ and consider
the set $f^{-1}([0, c])$. Notice that $f^{-1}(K) \subseteq f^{-1}([0,c]) = \{ x
\in \mathbb{R}^n: f(x) \leq c \}$. But since $f$ is radially unbounded, there
exists a $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$ such that whenever $x \in B_\delta(0)$, $f(x) >
c$. That is to say, $f^{-1}(K) \subseteq f^{-1}([0,c]) \subseteq B_\delta(0)$.
Hence $f^{-1}(K)$ is closed and bounded, i.e., compact, showing that $f$ is
proper.

``($\Leftarrow$)'' Assume that $f$ is proper so that $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact
whenever $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is. We want to show that $f(x)
\xrightarrow{\norm{x}{} \to \infty} \infty$. Argue ad absurdum. Suppose $f(x)$
does not approach $\infty$ as $\norm{x}{} \to \infty$. This means that there
exists $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) < c$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$. But
then $f^{-1}([0,c]) = \mathbb{R}^n$, which is not compact. This contradicts the
fact that $f$ is proper. \hfill \qed
