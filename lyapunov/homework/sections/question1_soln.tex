For the rotational motion of a rigid body in $3$D-space example, it is desired
to analyze the stability of an equilibrium of the form $(0, 0, z_0)$ where $z_0
\neq 0$. Set up a new set of coordinates such that the equilibrium under study 
is the origin of the new set. Define a suitable Lyapunov function such that the 
stability of the equilibrium can be established by applying Lyapunov stability 
theorem.

\begin{solution}

Consider the change of coordinates \[ x \mapsto x, \quad y \mapsto y, \quad z
\mapsto z_s := z - z_0, \] under which the system dynamics becomes $(\dot{x},
\dot{y}, \dot{z}_s) = f(x,y,z_s)$ where $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by 
\[ f(x,y,z) = \left(a y (z + z_0), -b x (z + z_0), c x y \right). \]
% \begin{align*}
%     \dot{x} &= a y (z_s + z_0), \\
%     \dot{y} &= -b x (z_s + z_0), \\
%     \dot{z}_s &= c x y.
% \end{align*}
%
Now, consider the Lyapunov function candidate $V: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ \[ V(x,y,z_s) = bx^2 + ay^2 + \left( bcx^2 + 2acy^2 + abz_s(z_s +
2z_0) \right)^2  \] This is a sum-of-squares polynomial function of $(x,y,z)$
and hence is positive definite. Further, we have $V(0,0,0) = 0$ and rote
computation shows that \[ \mc{L}_fV(x,y,z_s) = 0. \]
Hence, the equilibrium $(x,y,z) = (0,0,z_s)$ is stable.
