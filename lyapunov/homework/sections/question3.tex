Consider the autonomous differential equation \[ \dot{x}(t) = f(x(t)), \] and
suppose $f$ is a $C^1$ function such that $f(0) = 0$. Then there exists a $C^1$
matrix-valued function $A$ such that \[ f(x) = A(x)x, \;\; \forall x \in
\mathbb{R}^n. \]

\begin{parts}

\part[15] Show that if the matrix $A^\top(0) + A(0)$ is negative definite, then the
origin is an exponentially stable equilibrium. More generally, show that if
there exists a positive definite matrix $P$ such that $A^\top(0)P + PA(0)$ is
negative definite, then the origin is an exponentially stable equilibrium.
(Hint: Consider the Lyapunov function candidate $V(x) = \norm{x}{}^2$.)

\part[5] Extend the results in $(a)$ to global stability.
